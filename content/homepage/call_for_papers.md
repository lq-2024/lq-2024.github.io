Learning to Quantify (LQ - also known as “quantification“, or “supervised prevalence estimation“, or “class prior estimation“), is the task of training class prevalence estimators via supervised learning.  In other words, the task of these trained models is to estimate, given an unlabelled sample of data items and a set of classes, the prevalence (i.e., relative frequency) of each such class in the sample. 

LQ is interesting in all applications of classification in which the final goal is not determining which class (or classes) individual unlabelled data items belong to, but estimating the percentages of data items that belong to the classes of interest, i.e., estimating the distribution of the unlabelled data items across the classes. Example disciplines whose interest in labelling data items is at the aggregate level (rather than at the individual level), are the social sciences, political science, market research, ecological modelling, and epidemiology.  

While LQ may in principle be solved by classifying each data item in the sample and counting how many such items have been labelled with a certain class, it has been shown that this “classify and count” method yields suboptimal quantification accuracy. As a result, quantification is now no longer considered a mere byproduct of classification, and has evolved as a task of its own. 

The goal of this workshop is to bring together all researchers interested in methods, algorithms, evaluation measures, and methodologies for LQ, as well as practitioners interested in their practical application to managing large quantities of data.

We seek original, unpublished papers on topics of relevance to LQ; also papers currently under submission at other workshops / conferences / journals are welcome, provided this double submission does not violate the rules of these workshops / conferences / journals.

We seek papers on any of the following topics, which will form the main themes of the workshop:

- Binary, multiclass, and ordinal LQ
- Supervised algorithms for LQ
- Semi-supervised / transductive LQ
- Deep learning for LQ
- Representation learning for LQ
- LQ and dataset shift
- Evaluation measures for LQ
- Experimental protocols for the evaluation of LQ
- Quantification of streaming data
- Quantifying text by topic and quantifying text by sentiment
- Novel applications of LQ

and other topics of relevance to LQ.
